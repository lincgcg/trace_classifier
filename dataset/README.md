The datasets in the paper will be ready soon.

## dataset format
generate_a_dataset(sample).py shows how to generate a fake dataset.

Here is how one dataset looks like.

dataset = [sample1, sample2, sample3, ..., sample n]

sample = [[flow1, flow2, flow3, ..., flow n], label]

flow1 = [[packet vector1, packet vector2, packet vector3, ...,packet vector n]]
